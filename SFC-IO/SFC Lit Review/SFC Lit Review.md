## Key Features

### Balance Sheet Matrix

George, et al. (2025) identify the following table of High Level Financial Stocks in National Accounts required to develop the balance sheet matrix.

| Code | Description                                             |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| F.1  | Monetary gold and special drawing rights                |
| F.2  | Currency and deposits                                   |
| F.3  | Debt securities                                         |
| F.3  | Loans                                                   |
| F.3  | Equity and investment fund shares/units                 |
| F.3  | Insurance, pensions, and standardized guarantee schemes |
| F.3  | Financial derivatives and employee stock options        |
| F.3  | Other accounts receivable                               |

In order to establish a direct correspondence with the interest flows in the transaction flow matrix, the authors define an aggregated set of financial stocks:

| Description                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Interest-bearing financial stocks (F.2 + F.3 + F.4) |
| Equity (F.5)                                        |
| Insurance and Pensions (F.6)                        |
| Other Financial Stocks (F.1 + F.7 + F.8)            |

Which, after including capital stocks from the Household, Government, and NFC sectors, results in a final balance sheet matrix with the following structure:

| Real Assets and Financial Stocks           |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Housing capital stock                      |
| NFCs capital stock                         |
| Government capital stock                   |
| ------------------------------------------ |
| Total: real assets                         |
| ------------------------------------------ |
| Interest-bearing assets                    |
| Interest-bearing liabilities               |
| ------------------------------------------ |
| Equity - assets                            |
| Equity - liabilities                       |
| ------------------------------------------ |
| Pensions                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ |
| Total: financial net worth (1)             |
| Residual financial instrument (2)          |
| Actual financial net worth (3) = (1) + (2) |

Given the prevalence of insurance in Taiwan as a financial instrument, including this as a balance sheet item with pensions makes sense.
